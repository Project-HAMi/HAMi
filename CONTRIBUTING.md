# Before you get started

## Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Community Expectations

HAMi is a community project driven by its community which strives to promote a healthy, friendly and productive environment.

## AI Assistance Notice

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you are using **any kind of AI assistance** to contribute to HAMi,
> it must be disclosed in the pull request.

If you are using any kind of AI assistance while contributing to HAMi,
**this must be disclosed in the pull request**, along with the extent to
which AI assistance was used (e.g. docs only vs. code generation).
If PR responses are being generated by an AI, you must still disclose
it. This requires special care: you must fully understand the reviewer's
point and critically review any AI-generated text to ensure it is accurate
and directly addresses the feedback. Never paste AI output verbatim.
Failure to engage thoughtfully with reviews may result in your PR being
closed. As a small exception, trivial tab-completion doesn't need to be
disclosed, so long as it is limited to single keywords or short phrases.

An example disclosure:

> This PR was written primarily by Claude Code.

Or a more detailed disclosure:

> I consulted ChatGPT to understand the codebase but the solution
> was fully authored manually by myself.

Failure to disclose this is first and foremost rude to the human operators
on the other end of the pull request, but it also makes it difficult to
determine how much scrutiny to apply to the contribution.

In a perfect world, AI assistance would produce equal or higher quality
work than any human. That isn't the world we live in today, and in many cases
AI-generated code can contain subtle bugs or not adhere to project-specific
best practices. I say this despite being a fan of and using them successfully
myself (with heavy supervision)!

When using AI assistance, we expect contributors to understand the code
that is produced and be able to answer critical questions about it. It
isn't a maintainer's job to review a PR so broken that it requires
significant rework to be acceptable.

Please be respectful to maintainers and disclose AI assistance.

# Getting started

- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Make your changes in your forked repository
- Submit a Pull Request (PR)

# Your First Contribution

We will help you contribute in different areas such as filing issues, developing features, fixing critical bugs and
getting your work reviewed and merged.

If you have questions about the development process,
feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi/issues/new/choose).

## Find something to work on

We are always in need of help, whether it's fixing documentation, reporting bugs, or writing code.
Look for places where best coding practices aren't followed, code refactoring is needed, or tests are missing.
Here's how you can get started.

### Find a good first topic

There are [multiple repositories](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/) within the HAMi organization.
Each repository has beginner-friendly issues marked as "good first issues".
For example, [Project-HAMi/HAMi](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi) has
[help wanted](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and
[good first issue](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
labels for issues that should not require deep knowledge of the system.
We can help new contributors who wish to work on such issues.

Another good way to contribute is to find documentation improvements, such as fixing missing or broken links.
Please see [Contributing](#contributing) below for the workflow.

#### Work on an issue

When you are willing to take on an issue, simply reply to the issue and a maintainer will assign it to you.

### File an Issue

While we encourage everyone to contribute code, we also appreciate when someone reports an issue.
Issues should be filed under the appropriate HAMi sub-repository.

*Example:* A HAMi issue should be opened in [Project-HAMi/HAMi](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi/issues).

Please follow the provided submission guidelines when opening an issue.

# Contributor Workflow

Please never hesitate to ask questions or submit a pull request.

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base the contribution (usually master)
- Make commits of logical units
- Push changes in your topic branch to your personal fork of the repository
- Submit a pull request to [Project-HAMi/HAMi](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi)

## Creating Pull Requests

Pull requests are often called simply "PRs".
HAMi generally follows the standard [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process.
To submit a proposed change, please develop the code/fix and add new test cases.
Before submitting a pull request, run these local verifications to predict whether continuous integration will pass or fail:

* Run and pass `make verify`

## Code Review

To make it easier for your PR to receive reviews, consider that reviewers will need you to:

* Follow [good coding guidelines](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
* Write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* Break large changes into a logical series of smaller patches which individually make easily understandable changes, and in aggregate solve a broader issue
