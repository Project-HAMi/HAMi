# Volcano vgpu device plugin for Kubernetes

**Note**:

You *DON'T* need to install HAMi when using volcano-vgpu, only use  
[Volcano vgpu device-plugin](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/volcano-vgpu-device-plugin) is good enough. It can provide device-sharing mechanism for NVIDIA devices managed by volcano.

This is based on [Nvidia Device Plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin), it uses [HAMi-core](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi-core) to support hard isolation of GPU card.

Volcano vgpu is only available in volcano > 1.9

## Quick Start

### Install Volcano

helm repo add volcano-sh https://volcano-sh.github.io/helm-charts
helm install volcano volcano-sh/volcano -n volcano-system --create-namespace

### Configure scheduler

update the scheduler configuration:

```shell script
kubectl edit cm -n volcano-system volcano-scheduler-configmap
```

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: volcano-scheduler-configmap
  namespace: volcano-system
data:
  volcano-scheduler.conf: |
    actions: "enqueue, allocate, backfill"
    tiers:
    - plugins:
      - name: priority
      - name: gang
      - name: conformance
    - plugins:
      - name: drf
      - name: deviceshare
        arguments:
          deviceshare.VGPUEnable: true # enable vgpu
      - name: predicates
      - name: proportion
      - name: nodeorder
      - name: binpack
```

### Enabling GPU Support in Kubernetes

Once you have enabled this option on *all* the GPU nodes you wish to use,
you can then enable GPU support in your cluster by deploying the following Daemonset:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Project-HAMi/volcano-vgpu-device-plugin/main/volcano-vgpu-device-plugin.yml
```

### Verify environment is ready

Check the node status, it is ok if `volcano.sh/vgpu-number` is included in the allocatable resources.

```shell script
$ kubectl get node {node name} -oyaml
...
status:
  addresses:
  - address: 172.17.0.3
    type: InternalIP
  - address: volcano-control-plane
    type: Hostname
  allocatable:
    cpu: "4"
    ephemeral-storage: 123722704Ki
    hugepages-1Gi: "0"
    hugepages-2Mi: "0"
    memory: 8174332Ki
    pods: "110"
    volcano.sh/gpu-number: "10"    # vGPU resource
  capacity:
    cpu: "4"
    ephemeral-storage: 123722704Ki
    hugepages-1Gi: "0"
    hugepages-2Mi: "0"
    memory: 8174332Ki
    pods: "110"
    volcano.sh/gpu-memory: "89424"
    volcano.sh/gpu-number: "10"   # vGPU resource
```

### Running VGPU Jobs

VGPU can be requested by both set "volcano.sh/vgpu-number" , "volcano.sh/vgpu-cores" and "volcano.sh/vgpu-memory" in resource.limit

```shell script
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: gpu-pod1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: cuda-container
      image: nvidia/cuda:9.0-devel
      command: ["sleep"]
      args: ["100000"]
      resources:
        limits:
          volcano.sh/vgpu-number: 2 # requesting 2 gpu cards
          volcano.sh/vgpu-memory: 3000 # (optinal)each vGPU uses 3G device memory
          volcano.sh/vgpu-cores: 50 # (optional)each vGPU uses 50% core  
EOF
```

You can validate device memory using nvidia-smi inside container:

> **WARNING:** *if you don't request GPUs when using the device plugin with NVIDIA images all
> the GPUs on the machine will be exposed inside your container.
> The number of vgpu used by a container can not exceed the number of gpus on that node.*

### Monitor

volcano-scheduler-metrics records every GPU usage and limitation, visit the following address to get these metrics.

```
curl {volcano scheduler cluster ip}:8080/metrics
